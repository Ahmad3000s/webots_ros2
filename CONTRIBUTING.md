# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone.

## Create a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
2. Create a branch in your fork: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository
3. Pull the branch as a pull request targeting `omichel:webots_ros2@master`: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork
4. Wait for our unit tests and review of your pull request.

## Development Guideline

* Avoid comitting files that exist elsewhere. Instead we should link to the source of these files.
* Avoid comitting files that can be re-created from other files using a Makefile, a script or a compiler.
